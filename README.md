# Fair and Explainable Melanoma Diagnosis  
Integrating ResNet Classifiers, Grad-CAM, and Diffusion-Based Image Generation

This repository presents a deep learning pipeline for melanoma classification, focused on fairness and explainability. It includes two components:
- A classification module with integrated Grad-CAM for visual explainability
- A diffusion-based image generator for producing synthetic lesion data conditioned on metadata

---

## Overview

Melanoma is a highly aggressive skin cancer, and early diagnosis is critical. This project introduces a diagnostic system that addresses:
- Bias in skin-tone representation through targeted fine-tuning on Fitzpatrick17k
- Model interpretability through Grad-CAM visualizations
- Synthetic data augmentation using diffusion-based generative modeling

### Datasets
- **HAM10000**: Dermoscopic images of skin lesions
- **Fitzpatrick17k**: Clinical images labeled by Fitzpatrick skin type

---

## Classification Module (XAI)

**Notebooks:**
- `binary classification train.ipynb`: Trains ResNet models (18, 34, 50, 101) using HAM10000
- `testing XAI.ipynb`: Applies Grad-CAM to visualize model decisions and analyze fidelity
- `fine tuning.ipynb`: Fine-tunes models on Fitzpatrick17k and evaluates fairness

**Features:**
- Modular implementation using PyTorch and Lightning
- Reproducible results with fixed random seed
- Grad-CAM for visual attributions and explainability
- Performance evaluation stratified by skin tone

---

## Diffusion-Based Image Generator

**Notebooks:**
- `DiffusionM_training_fromZero.ipynb`: Trains a denoising diffusion model from scratch
- `DiffusionM_training_fromLastCheckpoint.ipynb`: Resumes training from a saved checkpoint
- `dermatological_samples_generator.ipynb`: Generates synthetic lesion images based on metadata

**Outputs:**
- 256Ã—256 RGB dermoscopic images
- Associated metadata in structured CSV format

**Directory Structure Required:**
```

## Installation and Requirements
